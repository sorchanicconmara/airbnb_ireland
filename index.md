In this article, I will dicuss my findings from analysing Airbnb data on listings in Ireland. The [data from Ireland](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) is free to access and was scraped from the Airbnb website in March, 2021. The data dictionary can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit#gid=982310896).

#### What is Airbnb?
> Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in that locale. It currently covers more > than 100,000 cities and 220 countries worldwide and has millions of hosts and travellers using it.

In Ireland, as of March 2021, there were over **26,000 listings**
and that number is growing as more and more people realise what a great opportunity it is to make some extra cash. In this blog post, I will reveal some of the key insights I discovered from analysing the Airbnb listings data for Ireland.


My first question was a simple one:
> 1. **Where in Ireland are Airbnbs the most expensive?** 

To my surpise, the most expensive listings based on average listing price were in County Louth. This however seemed odd, and upon investigating the distribution of AirBnBs, we can see that they are not equally distributed across Ireland and therefore the average price isn't a fair representation to group by. Any county with fewer listings (such as Louth), only needed one very expensive listing to pull its mean listing price up. 

When comparing this with the listing price grouped by the median (the middle price, when price is ordered), we can see a more realistic overview of Airbnb prices in Ireland.

2. **What counties have the fewest AirBnBs and could be areas potential hosts may consider listing a property in? Also, what kind of rooms are most popular in Ireland? (and therefore be considered by potential hosts)**


3. **What features affect the price of the listing? And to what extent? I.e. what do YOU need in your Airbnb to increase its value.** 
E.g.:

 - does being a superhost/the hosts tenure affect price?
 - does the number of bedrooms/bathrooms affect price? 
 - does the number of reviews/overall review score rating affect price?
    
    
4. **Can the price of a listing be predicted? What are the most influential features in predicting price?**
